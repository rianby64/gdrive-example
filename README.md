# QuickStart

In order to run this code, please, add a file called `credentials.json`. Follow the same format as `example.credentials.json`.
Then, run `go run quickstart.go` and check if you can see the expected google-drive.

## Tech part

There are in the code three different ways to apply the `credentials.json` into the authorization process. These functions are called `authByCredentials1()`, `authByCredentials2()`, `authByCredentials3()`.

I think it's enough to try with `authByCredentials1()`, but if you doubt then use all the options :smile:
